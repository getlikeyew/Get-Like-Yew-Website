        <h4 style="margin: ">Who Am I?</h4>
        <p>Born and raised in Flint, Michigan the middle child of five. I've always been an active person since playing tag & basketball in the neighborhood to football and track in middleschool and high school. I consider Costa Rica my second home
          where I attended <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uwc.org/">United World College</a> - sad to say I'm still <i>basura en futbol</i> but i did pick up an appreciation for ultimate frisbee.</p>
        <h4 style="margin: -5px">How Did I Get Here?</h4>
        <p> I came to Columbia University to study Financial Economics. I was still exercising but it became boring without a competitive goal. That feeling led me to join the taekowndo team for a few years before deciding to build my repertoire as a
          health professional on the side. I have team and individual sports to thank for inspiring me to combine my interest in teaching and fitness.</p>
        <h4 style="margin: -5px">What Am I Like?</h4>
        <p>A very chill guy. I like the outdoors, preferably beaches but woods are cool too. I'm into comics books, mostly DC and manga - currently following <i>Attack on Titan</i>, <i>Berserk</i>, and <i>The Promised Neverland</i>. I play video
          games - primarily PlayStation...duh. Stand-up comedy is a good time too. Always looking for an excuse to laugh.</p>
