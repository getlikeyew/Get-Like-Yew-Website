          <p style="text-align:left" id="dietInfo">Wondering if you should start a diet? Trick question, you aleady are! A diet is simply the kinds of food that a person, animal, or community habitually eats. Usually, when someone says <em>"I am
              starting a diet"</em> it really means "I am changing my eating habits". There is no one way to categorize all diets because what we eat is affected by an innumerable amount of things: genes, environment, culture, available resources etc. Check out our short list of diets to get a taste - <i>ah ha ha</i> - of all the ways you could be eating.</p>

The  <abbr title="United States Department of Agriculture">USDA</abbr> now uses the <a href="https://www.choosemyplate.gov/">MyPlate</a> diagram for its increased practicality.

To understand a food's complete effect on blood sugar, you need to know both how quickly it makes glucose enter the bloodstream and how much glucose per serving it can deliver. A separate measure called the glycemic load does both — which gives you a more accurate picture of a food's real-life impact on your blood sugar.
